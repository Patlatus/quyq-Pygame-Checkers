checkers.py

A simple checkers engine written in Python with the pygame 1.9.1 libraries.

Here are the rules I am using: http://boardgames.about.com/cs/checkersdraughts/ht/play_checkers.htm

I adapted some code from checkers.py found at 
http://itgirl.dreamhosters.com/itgirlgames/games/Program%20Leaders/ClareR/Checkers/checkers.py starting on line 159 of my program.

This is the final version of my checkers project for Programming Workshop at Marlboro College. The entire thing has been rafactored and made almost completely object oriented.

Funcitonalities include:

- Having the pieces and board drawn to the screen

- The ability to move pieces by clicking on the piece you want to move, then clicking on the square you would
  like to move to. You can change you mind about the piece you would like to move, just click on a new piece of yours.

- Knowledge of what moves are legal. When moving pieces, you'll be limited to legal moves.

- Capturing

- DOUBLE capturing etc.

- Legal move and captive piece highlighting

- Turn changes

- Automatic kinging and the ability for them to move backwords

- Automatic check for and end game. 

- A silky smoooth 60 FPS!
